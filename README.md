# Deepfake Detection Using CNN and CoAtNet (College Major Project)

This project focuses on building a **two-stage deepfake detection model** using  
1) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and  
2) a CoAtNet model combining convolution + self-attention.

The project follows preprocessing steps such as frame extraction, face detection, 
alignment, and normalization. Both models were evaluated on the UADFV dataset using 
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
